## To create this project I was inspired by the ability to synthesize digital circuits using the Verilog and System Verilog languages.From my own experience, I would like to note that many industrial controllers or programmable relays use “Functional block diagram” semantics as a description of control system algorithms. Naturally, the experience gained with this board can be easily used in industry to obtain reliable, efficient and inexpensive solutions.But and not only idustry.
## Further in this repository in the Examples package, examples of synthesized circuits will appear. The whole project: entirely built on enthusiasm. Therefore, you can become a co-author and contribute.
